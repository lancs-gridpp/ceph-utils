# Usage: activescrubs
#
# Show the pgs that are active scrubbing with automatic period updates.
#
# Things to do:
# * If an active scrub doesn't update the number of objects scrubbed on a refresh
#   it continues to be shown as active for an 'idle' period.  This is currently
#   based on the number of refreshes done since it stopped updating the number of
#   objects scrubbed.  This might be better being a timebased idle period.
# * include versioning.
